# Cybersecurity Basics
### Vulnerability Definition:
* #### A vulnerability represents a weakness within a system, application, or network that could be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access or cause harm.

* #### Examples: Examples of vulnerabilities include software bugs, misconfigurations, and inadequate security settings.

## Threat Definition
![various_threat](https://github.com/MaheshShukla1/CompTia-Security-prep/assets/95337825/16adafad-7ede-4dca-b349-c8b14a560bb6)

* #### A threat refers to any potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability, leading to harm against an asset, system, or network.

* #### Examples: Threats encompass malware, phishing attacks, and natural disasters.

## Threat Vector Definition
![threat_vector](https://github.com/MaheshShukla1/CompTia-Security-prep/assets/95337825/ea9360d0-9e35-42c4-af8b-1dec9abe36ea)

* #### A threat vector is the path or means through which a threat actor can access a system, network, or application to carry out malicious activities.

* #### Examples: Common threat vectors include email attachments, malicious websites, and compromised credentials.

## Exploit Definition 
* #### An exploit is a specific technique or tool used by threat actors to leverage a vulnerability and carry out an attack.

* #### Examples: Exploits include buffer overflow attacks, SQL injection attacks, and phishing emails.

## Controls and Countermeasures
![control_framework](https://github.com/MaheshShukla1/CompTia-Security-prep/assets/95337825/1e77587a-60f7-44fd-9551-8c35410ffc01)

* #### Definition: Controls are proactive measures, tactics, or strategies implemented to minimize risk by preventing, detecting, or mitigating potential threats.

* #### Examples: Firewalls, encryption, and multi-factor authentication are examples of controls.

## Countermeasures Definition 
* #### Countermeasures are specific controls deployed to address a particular threat, typically in a reactive manner to mitigate its impact.

* #### Examples: Applying patches to fix vulnerabilities and disabling compromised accounts are countermeasures.

## Characteristics of Effective Controls Functionality Definition 
* #### Functionality refers to what a control does and how it operates within a system to achieve its intended purpose.

* #### Examples: A firewall's functionality includes filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.

## Effectiveness Definition 
* #### Effectiveness measures how well a control works consistently, reliably, and in a timely manner to achieve its security objectives.

* #### Examples: An effective intrusion detection system (IDS) consistently detects and alerts on malicious activity without false positives.

## Assurance Definition 
* #### Assurance is the level of confidence that the implemented security controls are effective in their application and operation.

* #### Examples: Regular security audits and penetration tests provide assurance that controls are functioning as intended.

## Control Objectives Definition 
* #### Control objectives are statements outlining the desired outcomes or purposes to be achieved by implementing specific controls or sets of controls.

* #### Example Control Objective: Protect Host from Malware Exfiltration

## Controls

* Antivirus (AV) Software
* Host Firewall
* Restricted Email Attachments
* URL Filtering
* Sandboxing
* Defense-in-Depth (Layered Security)
* Definition: Defense-in-depth involves designing and implementing multiple overlapping layers of diverse controls to protect information systems.

## Principles:

* Controls should maintain independence and not be subject to a cascade effect.
* Consider diversity in control types and associated vendors.
* Security Control Baselines
* Definition: Security control baselines establish minimum standards for a given environment, providing a starting point for security implementation.

* Align control baselines strategically with organizational needs.
* Baselines should be proportional to asset criticality and sensitivity.
* Fine-Tuning Controls
* Definition: Fine-tuning controls involves optimizing security measures to ensure they provide the desired level of protection without unnecessary overhead or false positives.

## Baselines Modification Process Definition

* #### The process of modifying security control baselines to adapt to evolving threats, technologies, and business requirements.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis of Controls Definition

* #### Evaluating the costs of implementing controls against the benefits they provide in terms of risk reduction and security improvement.

## Questions and Responses for Implementing Security Controls
* #### Example Question 
* #### How can we assure stakeholders that the security baseline can be implemented within budget?

* #### Example Response: 
* #### Assure stakeholders that the baseline can be phased in over time, aligned with budget allocations, allowing for gradual implementation and adjustment based on resource availability and evolving needs.
